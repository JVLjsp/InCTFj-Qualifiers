You can see that the "mischief.jpg" is not just a picture while running binwalk on it.It is also a zip.After unziping you will get two files "flag.txt" and "busted.png".You can see that "flag.txt" is a png file if you run file on it.Comparing both png files you can see that "busted.png" is missing "0000" in its magic bytes.If you add that you will get the image containing the flag.
