Webpage contains python.When executed says :- send get request with viewsource parameter
After doing so we get the source code.
A string compare for get parameter flag to the real flag.This can be bypassed by passing flag parameter as an array.
Next checking if get parameter secret is of length 13 characters and value 1729 can be bypassed by 0000000001729 or by php type juggling since == used for comparing. 


filnal payload:-http://35.154.254.85/s3cur3PHP/index.php?viewsource&flag[]&secret=0000000001729
